There are a few friends of mine who use their credit cards to maintain their current lifestyle. It’s normal for them to use it for clothes, food, and even other expenses. Till that point, it’s fine.

In this process, what they generally forget is that they do not get the exact amount they pulled. Moreover, when converting to an EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment), the bank asks for some conversion charge along with GST, and on top of that, they also ask for the interest. So anyhow the individual involved in this might get what they want, but their debt keeps on increasing.

Assume I have a credit card and I have a certain limit, but I bought goods and services costing ₹10,000. Now, in order to not default, I take another credit card and pull an amount of ₹10,000 from that bank’s card.

As per the regulations, the merchant payment fees lie between 1-3%, so it costs between ₹100-₹300 for this transaction. If we take into consideration the option of EMI—which is 14-22% per annum interest rate—and charges ranging from 1-3.5%, that makes up for ₹774-₹1,231 in costs, plus GST from ₹139-₹222.
