As a resident of India, I do want it to grow exponentially. But is it right for this growth to come at the cost of increasing pollution? India, currently the fourth-largest economy, has three cities among the top twenty most polluted cities in the world, with New Delhi consistently leading the rankings.

Is pollution just an environmental problem, or does it also impact the economy? In economic terms, pollution is explained through the concept of a **negative externality**, also known as a **spillover effect**.

## What is a Negative Externality?
A negative externality occurs when the outcome of an economic activity affects a third party who is not directly involved in that activity, and does so negatively. For example, if a company pollutes a river, it constitutes a negative externality because the pollution is borne by individuals who rely on the river for water, livelihood, or health, despite not being involved in the firm’s production process.

In India, air pollution alone costs approximately 1–1.5% of GDP every year, primarily through healthcare expenses, productivity losses, and premature mortality.

## Why Does Pollution Continue to Rise?
From a layperson’s perspective, the answer is simple: economic activity moves where opportunity exists. Firms are profit-driven and tend to operate in regions where costs (including environmental compliance costs) are lower. In many cases, this translates into locations with lenient emission laws or weaker enforcement.

### The Pollution Haven Hypothesis
Economists analyze this behavior through the **Pollution Haven Hypothesis**. This suggests that polluting industries tend to relocate to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental regulations. The intuition is straightforward: environmental regulations raise the cost of pollution-intensive inputs, thereby reducing a region’s comparative advantage in such industries. Consequently, firms shift production to areas where regulatory oversight is weaker and compliance costs are lower.

## Case Study 1: Industrial Pollution (Laxmi Organics)
Laxmi Organics Industries, a specialty chemicals manufacturer in Maharashtra, illustrates how pollution-intensive industries can operate profitably when environmental costs are not fully internalized.

A recent judgment in Italy regarding the Miteni factory saw operators sentenced to accumulated prison time for polluting water for 350,000 people with "forever chemicals". Interestingly, the patents and machinery from that factory have been bought by this firm, which is currently involved in producing those goods. While the firm captures private gains, nearby communities bear the external costs through health risks and declining environmental quality.

## Case Study 2: Delhi’s Air Pollution
During winter months, PM2.5 levels in Delhi regularly exceed safe limits—sometimes 10–12 times above the World Health Organization’s recommended thresholds. This results in schools shutting down, offices shifting to hybrid work, and construction activity being temporarily halted.

Economically, pollution functions as an unplanned shock to the urban economy. Labour productivity declines as workers fall sick or reduce outdoor activity, and healthcare costs surge. These losses rarely appear explicitly in GDP figures but are very real on the ground.

## Case Study 3: Rivers as "Free Disposal Channels"
Rivers like the Ganga and Yamuna, once central to agriculture and urban water supply, are heavily burdened by untreated sewage and industrial effluents. The Ganga supplies water to nearly 40% of India’s population and serves an estimated 500 million people, yet it faces persistent challenges from industrial waste.

In Maharashtra, the Indrayani River near Alandi illustrates this deterioration; recent reports describe the river turning black and being covered in toxic foam and dead fish. Despite rejuvenation projects worth hundreds of crores, implementation has lagged. Industries and urban areas benefit from lower waste treatment costs by treating rivers as free disposal channels, leading to long-term welfare losses that markets fail to capture.

## Conclusion
India’s growth has delivered output and opportunity, but it has also relied on environmental costs that remain largely unpriced. Private benefits are captured while social costs are shared. Pollution persists not because growth is undesirable, but because markets and enforcement fail to internalize these costs. As long as polluting remains cheaper than preventing, firms will act rationally within flawed incentives.

The real question is not whether India should grow, but whether growth that weakens health, productivity, and natural assets can sustain itself in the long run.
