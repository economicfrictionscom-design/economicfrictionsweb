More people are working in India today, yet job security feels weaker because the supply of labour has grown faster than the availability of stable employment. Population pressure, intense competition, uneven skill distribution, technological change, and a service-heavy growth model together reduce bargaining power and increase the sense of replaceability.

India’s workforce continues to expand steadily due to population growth, while the economy struggles to generate a proportional number of stable jobs. Although the country has been able to absorb a large population within its demographic limits, the labour market has faced greater strain. A significant share of this workforce is absorbed by the service sector. In many development paths, economies typically move from agriculture to industry and then to services, but in India’s case, the shift toward services happened rapidly without the expansion of a broad industrial base. This has placed additional pressure on the labour market, as manufacturing and large-scale industry traditionally generate stable, mid-skill employment at scale.

The absence of a deeply developed industrial sector limits the economy’s ability to absorb a growing workforce. While services, often linked to multinational firms and global demand, have supported growth and output, they tend to generate fewer secure jobs relative to the size of the labour force. At the same time, the pace of industrial expansion has remained slower than the growth of India’s working-age population and labour force. Manufacturing and large-scale industry have not expanded enough to match the steady inflow of new entrants into the job market, increasing pressure on workers as limited job creation coincides with rising expectations for productivity and efficiency.

Industries, in their pursuit of efficiency and eventually profit, adapt to new technologies and systems faster, whereas the system fails to inculcate these changes into the next generation of recruits-in-the-making. This means that even while individuals possess recent academic knowledge, they often lack industrial and market knowledge, making them ineligible for the work they were trained to do. The result is increasing stress and competition. Individuals are asked to invest more effort and time just to remain employable, while evolving industries simultaneously face a shortage of appropriate skill sets. This limits industrial growth, reduces competitiveness, and prevents the creation of new job opportunities, bringing the labour market back to the same stage where it started.

All of this, when combined, shows how the Indian labour market is struggling. This struggle translates directly into the experiences of individuals operating within it. That is why phrases such as “competition is increasing, you need to work hard,” “skills are more valued than marks these days,” and even “AI will eat up many jobs” are commonly heard. When these ideas are fed into the upcoming workforce, they create stress and insecurity even before individuals step into the job market. Once they do enter, repeated denials due to skill mismatches, combined with emerging technological competition and constant pressure, reinforce a persistent feeling of insecurity and the fear of job loss.
